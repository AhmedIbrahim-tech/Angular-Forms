# Angular Forms

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 16.1.3.

## Introduction
Angular Forms is a powerful feature of the Angular framework that provides a robust and flexible way to handle user input and data validation within your web applications. 
With Angular Forms, you can easily create dynamic and interactive forms, capture user input, perform data validation, and handle form submission.


## Key Features

1. Template-driven and Reactive Forms: Angular Forms offers two approaches to building forms - Template-driven and Reactive Forms. Template-driven forms are driven by the template and require minimal code, while Reactive Forms provide a more flexible and code-centric approach.

2. Two-way Data Binding: Angular Forms leverages two-way data binding, allowing you to automatically update the model when the form control value changes and vice versa. This simplifies the process of synchronizing data between the user interface and the underlying data model.

3. Validation and Error Handling: Angular Forms provides a rich set of built-in validators for common form validations, such as required fields, email format, and pattern matching. It also allows you to create custom validators to enforce complex validation rules. Error handling mechanisms make it easy to display validation errors to users and customize error messages.

4. Form Controls and Form Groups: Angular Forms introduce the concept of form controls and form groups. Form controls represent individual input elements (e.g., text fields, checkboxes), while form groups are used to group related form controls together. This hierarchical structure enables you to manage the state and validation of complex forms.

5. Dynamic Form Manipulation: Angular Forms enables dynamic manipulation of forms at runtime. You can add or remove form controls, update validation rules, and adjust the form structure based on user interactions or application logic. This flexibility allows for dynamic form rendering and adapts to changing requirements.

6. Form Submission and Data Handling: Angular Forms provides methods to handle form submission, including handling form data, making HTTP requests, or triggering custom actions. You can easily integrate form submission with Angular's HTTP client or other external services.
